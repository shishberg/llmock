1. Run `bd ready` to decide which task to work on first. This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority - not necessarily the first in the list.
2. Check any feedback loops, such as types and tests.
3. Append your progress to the ralph/progress.txt file.
4. Make a git commit of that feature.
5. Close the beads task.
