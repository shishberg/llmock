1. Run `bd ready` to decide which task to work on first. This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority - not necessarily the first in the list.
2. Check any feedback loops, such as types and tests.
3. Append your progress to the ralph/progress.txt file.
4. Make a git commit of that feature.
5. Close the beads task.
6. Don't bother trying `git push`, you don't have credentials.

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE.

DO NOT USE PLAN MODE.

If, after you're done, there are follow-up tasks that need to be done to complete this task, use `bd create` to create them.
